    <h1>A Hunter's Dream</h1>

    
       
    <h3>Deer Hunting</h3>
        <div class="p"><p>When I was younger, the only thing I wanted to do was deer hunt. I used to watch old VHS tapes for hours of people taping their hunts. These hunters would kill monster bucks which just taunted me because I was creating a passion for an activity I had never even done. About a year or two goes by and my father finally took me on my first deer hunt. At that time, I was the most determined 5-year-old in the state of Georgia to kill a deer. I found out real fast that the gun he gave me to kill my first deer did not even fire.</p>
        
        <p>As time went on, my passion for deer hunting disappeared and got replaced with duck hunting. My best conclusion as to why is that I got tired of not getting the opportunity to kill a big buck. Last year that streak of no opportunity ended when I was bow hunting. The biggest buck I had ever seen in person stepped out in front of me within 25 yards, an easy bow kill. Sadly, I shot and missed. I was sick to my stomach, but looking back now that was one of the greatest things to happen to me. Missing that once in a lifetime shot also relit a fire in my soul. The passion and eagerness to deer hunt were back at last but more than ever. I was ready for redemption, and I knew I would not miss my shot again.</p> 
        
        <p>This year, thanks to my father, I got my shot at redemption and did not accept failure as an option. A deer we named Flop stepped out almost 200 yards in front of me the first time I hunted my new stand. This time I was rifle hunting. I patiently waited for Flop to turn broadside so I could get a clean shot at him. While I waited, I tried my best to gather my breath and calm my nerves. When I saw my opportune shot, I exhaled softly and squeezed the trigger. The only thing I saw after that was my dream/goal ever since a 5-year-old finally accomplished. Flop, a true monster in the state of Georgia, scored 153 inches and was the biggest buck anyone in my family has ever killed in Georgia.</p>
